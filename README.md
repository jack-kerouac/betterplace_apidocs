It incorporates some ideas from [hypermedia apis](https://www.google.de/search?q=hypermedia+api)
like the link-strukture.

### Client API

This part of the API can only be used in agreement with betterplace.org.
Please [contact someone at betterplace solutions](http://www.betterplace-solutions.de/#buergerzeitung)
for more information.

* [**Client** Details/Statistics](sections/client_details.md)
* [**Client** Donations List](sections/client_donations_list.md)
* [**Client** Projects List and Search](sections/projects_list.md) – See client section and ⁂1
* [**Client** Project Details](sections/project_details.md) – See client section and ⁂1
* [**Client** Blog Posts List](sections/blog_posts_list.md) – See client section

*(⁂1) Client projects:* Clients projects are projects on betterplace.org that are
associated with a client-user. This way clients can control what projects
are visible on their plattform.

*Request-URLs:* Clients have to prepend some requests with their client-id.
For projects that would be `/clients/PERMALINK/projects.json` and `/clients/PERMALINK/projects/ID.json`.
More information can be found in the description of each request.

*Error Code:* If you request data for a project that is not part of the client
projects, the API will return a `404` HTTP code.

*Usage example:* The local german newspaper "Trierischer Volksfreund"
has it's own donation portal at ["Meine Hilfe zählt"](http://www.meine-hilfe-zaehlt.de/).
All data are pulled from this api. In addition they use the betterplac.rog whitelabel donation form, which
is another service betterplace.org provides for clients.


### Client Authentication

In order to use some special features of the betterplace API, you need to authenticate yourself with an API-Token. These tokens are provided by betterplace, please
[contact betterplace solutions](http://www.betterplace-solutions.de/#buergerzeitung) if you are interested.

To authenticate with a token you'll need to pass it as an additional http header `Api-Token` or with an additional http parameter `api_token`.

* [Contact Data Details](sections/contact_data_details.md)


## General information

* The API is https only, all non-https requests will be redirected accordingly
* The response format is json, the request format extention .json
* The response language is defined by the URL-language-prefix (/en/, /de/ (default))
* We support [Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), so no proxy or JSONP is required
* No Authentication: All api calls are public at the moment but there will be
  feature that require authentication in the future.

### Request parameter format

The `order` and `facets` request parameters accept multiple key-value-parameter.
We use the same convention as the [Google Static Maps API V2](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#URL_Parameters).

Example: `foo:bar|lorem:ipsum`

This way you may specify a primary and secondaray sort order: `order=rank:ASC|created_at:DESC`

* Split key and value by a colon `:`
* Split multiple key-value-parameter by a pipe `|` (`%7C`)
* [URL encode](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL-Encoding) all params, so the Pipe becomes `%7C`
* Note that for readability-reasons we don't URL encode the params in this documentation


### List parameters and attributes

The following request parameters can be set for all list views.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Default</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>page</code></td>
    <td>Used to paginate through the list</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>per_page</code></td>
    <td>The number of entries per page</td>
    <td>20</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The following attributes are returned in all list view responses:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Attribute</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>total_entries</code></td>
    <td>Count of all entries</td>
    <td>23</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>offset</code></td>
    <td>The number of entries that are skipped before the current listing begins, <code>= max(page - 1, 0) * per_page</code></td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>total_pages</code></td>
    <td>Count of all pages, based on <code>per_page</code></td>
    <td>42</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>current_page</code></td>
    <td>What page we are on</td>
